It depends on who will use your script:
* Yourself only - $HOME/bin like @waltinator said
* You and other local users - /usr/local/bin
* root only - /usr/local/sbin




You should put your script under $HOME/bin. Follow below PATH to achieve this:
1. Create a folder using mkdir 
2. 
3. 
4. mkdir      $HOME/bin
5. mv *.sh   $HOME/bin
6. Finally, add the following line under 
7. 
echo “” export PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH" “” >>  $HOME/.bashrc
